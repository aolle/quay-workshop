Quay supports adding notifications to a repository for various events that occur in the repository lifecycle, such as a new image push or tag deletion.

[#pushnotif]
== Creating a push to repository event notification

* From the Red Hat Quay Dashboard, go to the `olleb/kafka` repository. Remind from xref:quay-repos.adoc[2.2 Quay Repositories], we created and pushed a `strimzi/kafka` image.

* Click `Settings`.

* Click on the `+ Create Notification` button.

* In the `When this event occurs` drop-down menu, select `Push to Repository`.

= Quay Repository Notifications
include::_attributes.adoc[]

Quay supports adding notifications to a repository for various events that occur during the repository lifecycle, such as when a new image is pushed or a tag is deleted.

[#pushnotif]
== Creating a Push-to-Repository Event Notification

* From the Red Hat Quay Dashboard, navigate to the `olleb/kafka` repository. Recall from xref:quay-repos.adoc[2.2 Quay Repositories] that we previously created and pushed a `strimzi/kafka` image.

* Click `Settings`.

* Click the `+ Create Notification` button.

* In the `Recipient` drop-down menu, select `owners`.

* In the `Notification title` text field, enter `A new image has been pushed into the repository`.

Push a new image or add a new tag to the existing one in the repository.

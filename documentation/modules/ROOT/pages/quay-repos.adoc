[#imagerepo]
== Creating an image repository

* Click `Create New Repository`.

[#imglayers]
== Inspecting image layers

* Navigate to the `olleb/kafka` repository.

* Click the `Tags` icon.

* Click on the `SHA256` value under `MANIFEST` of the `3.1.0` tag to see the layers dashboard.

[#pull]
== Pull an image from the repository

* From Quay dashboard, click on `olleb/kafka` repository.

* Click `Tags`.

* On any of the tags, click the `Fetch Tag` icon.

* Select `Docker Pull (by tag)` from the `Image Format` drop down and click the `Copy Command` button.

* Switch to a terminal, paste and execute the command on it. Docker or podman is required. If we're using podman, we have to replace the `docker` with `podman` before execute the command.
As we created the repository as `Public`, login is not required to pull.

[#tm]
== Time machine

Quay provide us a way for reviewing the history of tags and revert those to a previous image.

In this section, we create a new repository to avoid mistakes.

* Create a new image repository as already explained. I created the `olleb/timemachine` repository.

* Build an image, tag it and push it.

echo "FROM scratch" > Dockerfile.tm
podman build . -t timemachine -f Dockerfile.tm

podman tag localhost/timemachine ${QUAY_HOSTNAME}/olleb/timemachine:latest
podman push ${QUAY_HOSTNAME}/olleb/timemachine:latest
----

* Verify that the image has been pushed into Quay repository. Check also the manifest digest and the layers.

image::repositories/tm-latest1.png[]

image::repositories/tm-layers1.png[]

* Add a new layer, build, tag it with the same tag as before and push the new image.

echo "LABEL org.opencontainers.image.authors="angel@olleb.com"" >> Dockerfile.tm
podman build . -t timemachine -f Dockerfile.tm

podman tag localhost/timemachine ${QUAY_HOSTNAME}/olleb/timemachine:latest
podman push ${QUAY_HOSTNAME}/olleb/timemachine:latest
----

* Verify that the image has been pushed into Quay repository. Check also the manifest digest and the layers. Observe that the manifest digest and the layers are different than the previous image.

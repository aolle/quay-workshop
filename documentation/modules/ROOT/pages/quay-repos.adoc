[#imagerepo]
== Creating an image repository

* Click on the `Create New Repository` button.

image::repositories/create-repo.png[]

* Select the organization from the drop-down list, name the repository `kafka`, and set the visibility to `public`.

image::repositories/repo-config.png[]

* Click `Create Public Repository`.

[#push]
== Push (and tag) an image into the repository

* Pull an image from the public registry by running the `podman pull` command followed by the name of the image.

[#imglayers]
== Inspecting image layers

* Navigate to the `olleb/kafka` repository.

* Click on the `Tags` icon.

* Click on the `SHA256` value located under `MANIFEST` section of the `3.2.1` tag to view the layers dashboard.

[#pull]
== Pull an image from the repository

* From the Quay dashboard, locate and select the `olleb/kafka` repository.

* Click on the `Tags` tab.

* Select any of the repository\'s tags by clicking on it, click on the `Fetch Tag` icon.

image::repositories/fetchtagpre.png[]

* Select `Podman Pull (by tag)` from the `Image Format` drop-down menu and click on the `Copy Command` button.

image::repositories/fetchtag.png[]

* Switch to a terminal, paste the command you copied from the Quay UI, and then execute it. Make sure you have `Podman` installed on your system. Since we created the repository as `Public`, no login is required to pull the image.

[#rollback]
== Image rollback

Quay provides us with a convenient way to review the history of tags associated with an image repository.

* Create a new image repository as already explained. In this case, create a public repository named `olleb/rollback` on Quay.

* Build an image, tag it and push it.

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
echo "FROM scratch" > Containerfile.rbk
podman build . -t rollback:1.0 -f Containerfile.rbk

podman tag localhost/rollback:1.0 ${QUAY_HOSTNAME}/olleb/rollback:latest
podman push ${QUAY_HOSTNAME}/olleb/rollback:latest
----

* Verify that the image has been pushed into Quay repository. Check also the manifest digest and the layers.

image::repositories/rblatest1.png[]

image::repositories/rblayers1.png[]

* Add a new layer to the Containerfile, rebuild the image, and *overwrite* the old one by tagging and pushing it with the same remote tag.

----
echo "LABEL org.opencontainers.image.authors=angel@olleb.com" >> Containerfile.rbk
podman build . -t rollback:2.0 -f Containerfile.rbk

podman tag localhost/rollback:2.0 ${QUAY_HOSTNAME}/olleb/rollback:latest
podman push ${QUAY_HOSTNAME}/olleb/rollback:latest
----

* Verify that the new image has been pushed to the Quay repository and check its manifest digest and layers in the Quay UI. You should observe that the manifest digest and layers are different from the previous image.

image::repositories/rblatest2.png[]

image::repositories/rblayers2.png[]

* To rollback the image to the previous one, navigate to the Quay UI and click on the `Tag History` option for the repository. From there, select the tag for the previous image that you want to rollback to.

image::repositories/taghistory.png[]

* Click on `Revert to ...`.

image::repositories/revert.png[]

* Click on the `Restore Tag` button. This will restore the image for that tag to the previous image.

image::repositories/restoretag.png[]

* To verify that the image has been restored to the previous one in the tag history, go to the `Tag History` section in the Quay UI and check that the restored tag has the same manifest digest and layers as the previous image that was reverted to.

[#expiration]
== Image expiration

To configure an image tag to expire from Quay on a specific time and date, follow these steps:

* Create a new image repository as already explained. I created the `olleb/expiration` repository.

* Build a `1.0` image, tag it and push it to the `olleb/expiration` repository.

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
echo "FROM scratch" > Containerfile.exp
podman build . -t exp:1.0 -f Containerfile.exp

podman tag localhost/exp:1.0 ${QUAY_HOSTNAME}/olleb/expiration:1.0
podman push ${QUAY_HOSTNAME}/olleb/expiration:1.0
----

* The label `quay.expires-after` is used to indicate the expiration time for the tag. The value of the label can be specified in a number of different formats, including a specific time and date, a relative time offset from the time of image creation, or a relative time offset from the time of tag creation. In this case, we will use the relative time offset of `5m`, which specifies that the image should expire 5 minutes after it is tagged with the `2.0` and latest `tags`.

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
echo "LABEL org.opencontainers.image.authors=angel@olleb.com" >> Containerfile.exp
echo "LABEL quay.expires-after=5m" >> Containerfile.exp
podman build . -t exp:2.0 -f Containerfile.exp

podman tag localhost/exp:2.0 ${QUAY_HOSTNAME}/olleb/expiration:2.0
podman push ${QUAY_HOSTNAME}/olleb/expiration:2.0

podman tag localhost/exp:2.0 ${QUAY_HOSTNAME}/olleb/expiration:latest
podman push ${QUAY_HOSTNAME}/olleb/expiration:latest
----

* We now have two images and three tags in our `olleb/expiration` repository. The `1.0` image has a `1.0` tag, the `2.0` image has `2.0` and `latest` tags. The `latest` and the `2.0` tag are marked as expiring soon.

image::repositories/exp1.png[]

After 5 minutes, both tags will be removed from the repository automatically.

image::repositories/taghistoryautodeleted.png[]

* Select the `1.0` tag, in the `Actions` drop-down list, select `Change Tags Expiration`. Set the desired `Expiration Date`.

image::repositories/expirationdatetag.png[]

TIP: Alternatively, the expiration can also be set by clicking on the `Options` icon and selecting `Change Expiration`.

When the tag is about to expire, a message will be displayed:

image::repositories/abouttoexpire.png[]

NOTE: By default, the minimum expiration time is one hour and the maximum is 104 weeks (approximately 2 years) at the time of this writing. If you want to allow for earlier or later minimum expiration times, you can set the `LABELED_EXPIRATION_MINIMUM` property to a different time value, such as `60s` (seconds), `5m` (minutes), `24h` (hours), `7d` (days), or `2w` (weeks). This configuration must be placed in the `Config Bundle Secret` of your registry instance. An example of how to do this is explained in section xref:quay-oci.adoc#allowed[2.5.1 Configuring allowed OCI artifact types].

When the tag expires, it is deleted automatically.

image::repositories/tagexpireddeleted.png[]

Note that even though the tag is deleted, we can still restore the image. The reason is that when a tag is deleted and there are no other tags pointing to the same image, the image is not immediately deleted. Instead, it is marked for garbage collection, which by default occurs after 14 days (`2w`). Quay has a garbage collection worker enabled by default which runs periodically and removes the expired images when the configured *Time Machine* amount of time has passed.

As we stored the image inside `olleb` organization, we can check that value by browsing to `/organization/olleb?tab=settings`.

image::repositories/orgexptime.png[]

If the image stored is under the user account instead on an organization, the value can be found under user settings

The Time Machine amount time can be modified by changing the value of the `TAG_EXPIRATION_OPTIONS` array property, which must include the default expiration value `DEFAULT_TAG_EXPIRATION` in the list. An example of how to modify this value is explained in section xref:quay-oci.adoc#allowed[2.5.1 Configuring allowed OCI artifact types].

For example, with the following custom configuration:

image::repositories/expcfg.png[]

we will see:

include::_attributes.adoc[]

Red Hat OpenShift provides an onboard observability. The Quay Operator adds an embedded/integrated Quay Dashboard into the graphical Red Hat OpenShift console; there is where we can observe the healthiness, rates, latency and more of our Quay registry.

* Open a browser window and log in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

* From the Administrator perspective, click `Observe` â†’ `Dashboards`.

* In the `Dashboard` drop down, select `Quay - quay-workshop - registry`.

Scan pod images with the Red Hat Quay Container Security Operator (CSO).

The Container Security Operator brings Quay and Clair metadata to Kubernetes / Red Hat OpenShift, allowing us to scan images for vulnerabilities and compliance issues. This helps ensure that the images used in our pods are secure and compliant with relevant standards.

[#install]
== Installing the Quay CSO Operator

* Open a browser window and log in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

* From the Administrator perspective, click `Operators`, then `OperatorHub`.

* In the `Filter by keyword` field, type `Quay`.

* Click `Install` to start the installation process.

[#vulncheck]
== Checking the image vulnerabilities through the OpenShift web console

* Deploy a vulnerable image. For this example, we are going to deploy an old httpd vulnerable image.

# Pull the image
podman pull registry.redhat.io/rhel8/httpd-24:1-30

# Tag the image
podman tag registry.redhat.io/rhel8/httpd-24:1-30 ${QUAY_HOSTNAME}/olleb/httpd-24:1-30

# Push it to our Quay registry
podman push ${QUAY_HOSTNAME}/olleb/httpd-24:1-30
----

* Navigate to the Quay Registry Endpoint and select the `olleb/httpd-24` repository that has been automatically created when we pulled the image before.

* Select `Settings` and then click `Make Public`.

* Open the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console and create a new project by clicking `Projects` then `Create Project`. Name the project as `vuln-httpd` and then click `Create`.

* In the `vuln-httpd` project, deploy the vulnerable image by clicking `Workloads` then `Deployments`. Click `Create Deployment`.

* Replace the default image value with the image from our Quay registry. Set replicas as desired and set `httpd` as the custom name.

* Click `Create`.

* Red Hat OpenShift will start the deployment and create the pod. Go to `Workloads` then `Pods` and select one of the `httpd` pods. Select the `Vulnerabilities` tab.

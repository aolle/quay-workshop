[#tools]
== Container Management Tools

The following tools are required for running the exercises in this tutorial. 
Please have them installed and configured before you get started with any of the tutorial chapters.

include::partial$tools.adoc[]

[#quay]
== Red Hat Quay Prerequisites

[#odf]
== ODF Operator

You can use the OpenShift Container Platform web console to install Quay prerequisites.

* Open a browser window and log in to the OpenShift Container Platform web console.

* From the Administrator perspective, click `Operators` → `OperatorHub`.

* In the `Filter by keyword` field, type `ODF`.

* Select the OpenShift Data Foundation tile and click `Install`.

image::install/odf-install.png[]

* On the Install Operator page select `stable-4.10` from the list of available Update Channel options. Choose `A specific namespace on the cluster` and leave the default vaule of Installed Namespace as `openshift-storage`. Update approval `Automatic`. Console plugin `Enable`.

* Click `Install`.

[#storage]
== Creating the StorageSystem instance

To use the ODF Operator a StorageSystem instance is required. This is an example for an OCP standard and fresh installation (RHPDS) and may vary depending on your environment.

* From the Administrator perspective, click `Operators` → `Installed Operators`.

* Select `openshift-storage` project and OpenShift Data Foundation.

* Click on `Create StorageSystem` button.

* On the Create StorageSystem select `Use an existing StorageClass` and the `gp2` storage class. Click Next.

* Click on `Create StorageSystem`.

[#quayoperator]
== Installing Quay Operator

You can use the OpenShift Container Platform web console to suscribe and deploy the `Red Hat Quay Operator`.

* Open a browser window and log in to the OpenShift Container Platform web console.

* From the Administrator perspective, click `Operators` → `OperatorHub`.

* In the Filter by keyword field, type `Red Hat Quay`.

image::install/operatorhub-quay.png[]

* Select the Red Hat Quay tile and click `Install`.

image::install/quayoperator-install.png[]

* On the Install Operator page select `stable-3.7` from the list of available Update Channel options. Choose `All namespaces on the cluster (default)` as installation mode. Choose `Automatic` update approval.

image::install/quayoperator-opts.png[]

* Click `Install`.

[#quayinstance]
== Deploying Quay

* Create a `quay-workshop` project.

* From the Administrator perspective, click `Operators` → `Installed Operators`. Project: `quay-workshop`. Select Red Hat Quay operator.

* Click on Create instance (Quay Registry).

image::install/create-quay-instance.png[]

* Change the Name if desired. Click on `Create`.

WARNING: Check if the init container fails during the Quay registry deployment. In this case, watch out if a `LimitRange` exists in the current `OCP` project. Sometimes, the `RHPDS` environment creates a `LimitRange` automatically when a new project is created.

[#exportenvvar]
== Export environment variables

IMPORTANT: The command-line or shell will be used during the workshop. The `QUAY_HOSTNAME` environment variable has to be set in the working terminal before executing the commands. Alternatively, we can provide the hostname directly.

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
QUAY_HOSTNAME=$(oc get route registry-quay -n quay-workshop -o jsonpath={.spec.host})

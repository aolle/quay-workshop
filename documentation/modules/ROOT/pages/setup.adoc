[#tools]
== Container Management Tools

The following tools are required to run the exercises in this tutorial. Please ensure that they are installed and properly configured before proceeding with any of the tutorial chapters.

include::partial$tools.adoc[]

[#quay]
== Red Hat Quay Prerequisites

[#odf]
== ODF Operator

You can use the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console to install Quay prerequisites by following these steps:

* Open a browser window and log in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

* From the Administrator perspective, click on `Operators` and then select `OperatorHub`.

* In the `Filter by keyword` field, type `ODF`.

* Select the Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation tile and click `Install` button.

image::install/odf-install.png[]

* On the Install Operator page, select `stable-4.10` from the list of available Update Channel options, and then choose A specific namespace on the cluster. Leave the default value of Installed Namespace as openshift-storage, and set the Update Approval to Automatic. Also, make sure to set `Enable` the Console Plugin.

* Click `Install`.

[#storage]
== Creating the standalone object gateway

For workshop testing purposes, we will deploy the Multi-Cloud Object Gateway (MCG) component provided by the Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation Operator.

The MCG provides a S3-compatible object storage interface for our Quay deployment managed by the Operator. The gateway is used in combination with the Kubernetes `PersistentVolume` storage, which is mounted on the gateway as a backing store for object storage, and any block-based `StorageClass` is supported.

NOTE: This is not a high-availability (HA) solution.

* Create the NooBaa object storage:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: noobaa.io/v1alpha1
kind: NooBaa
metadata:
  name: noobaa
  namespace: openshift-storage
spec:
 dbResources:
   requests:
     cpu: '0.1'
     memory: 1Gi
 dbType: postgres
 coreResources:
   requests:
     cpu: '0.1'
     memory: 1Gi
EOF
----

* After some time, verify if the MCG has been provisioned:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc get -n openshift-storage noobaas noobaa
----

NOTE: After creating the Multi-Cloud Object Gateway, a new default backing store for all the `ObjectBucketClaim` issued by the Operator is automatically created.

[#quayoperator]
== Installing Quay Operator

You can use the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console to suscribe and deploy the `Red Hat Quay Operator`.

* Open a browser window and log in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

* From the Administrator perspective, click on `Operators` and then select `OperatorHub`.

* In the Filter by keyword field, type `Red Hat Quay`.
    
image::install/operatorhub-quay.png[]

* Select the Red Hat Quay tile and click on the `Install` button.

image::install/quayoperator-install.png[]

* On the Install Operator page, select `stable-3.8` from the list of available Update Channel options. Then, choose `All namespaces on the cluster (default)` as the installation mode and select `Automatic` for update approval.

image::install/quayoperator-opts.png[]

* Click `Install`.

[#quayinstance]
== Deploying Quay

* Create a new `quay-workshop` project.

* From the Administrator perspective, navigate to `Operators` and then select `Installed Operators`. Choose the `quay-workshop` project and select the Red Hat Quay operator.

* Click `Create instance` to create a new Quay Registry instance.

image::install/create-quay-instance.png[]

* If desired, change the name, and then click Create.

WARNING: Please check if the init container fails during the Quay registry deployment. If it fails, please verify if a `LimitRange` exists in the current `OCP` project. Sometimes, the `RHPDS` environment creates a `LimitRange` automatically when a new project is created.

[#exportenvvar]
== Export environment variables

IMPORTANT: It is recommended to set the `QUAY_HOSTNAME` environment variable in the working terminal before executing the commands. Alternatively, the hostname can be provided directly in the commands as needed.

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
QUAY_HOSTNAME=$(oc get route registry-quay -n quay-workshop -o jsonpath={.spec.host})
----
